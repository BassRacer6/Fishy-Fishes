# Fishy-Fishes
Overall, the code is highly efficient in terms of organization and memory usage. The potential improvements in these aspects—many of which I learned throughout the project—have not been applied due to lack of necessity, as it is already well-optimized for this initial and sample version. There are few comments since I worked on this code alone and did not require them.

Fishy Fishes is a game inspired by the classic Fishy, but with a unique style and significant innovations in both mechanics and design.

Developing it was my second project in C#, providing a valuable learning opportunity and serving as a solid example of my programming skills.
